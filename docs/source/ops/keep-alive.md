## Running instructions
`cbfs_auto_install.sh` will use the provided parameters to create `client.conf` in the `./volName` path, and mount the volume, add the restart rule to `crontab`.By default, the cbfs_restart script is executed once per minute.

cbfs_restart.sh: used to restart the crashed client, automatically mount at a scheduled time
cbfs_clean.sh: used to clean up the mount point and crontab rules, needs to be executed manually
